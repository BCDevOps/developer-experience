# Resource Management Guidelines

Resource management is a vital skill for working on the platform. Itâ€™s something teams need to learn so they can work cooperatively with others on the platform.

Once your team starts making use of the platform, you'll need to consider what it means for your team to be a good platform citizen.
Resource management is about teams ensuring they make fair use of our shared resources. 
In other words, if we give a little to others, we can get some of what we want as well!

Teams can learn a lot about appropriate resource management from other teams. When more experienced teams model good resource management on the platform, it gives newer teams a great example to follow.

This doesn't mean that you'll be unable to resource what you need or that your team will have to make do with fewer resources than they'd like.
Instead, resource management is about making sure that your team isn't claiming resources you aren't using, which could be put to better use by other teams who might need those resources.
