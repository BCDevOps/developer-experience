### KeyCloak Migration

Hi team, we are in the process of transforming KeyCloak from a pathfinder service to a organizational BCGov service. For more information on this service, refer to [here](https://developer.gov.bc.ca/BC-Government-SSO-Service-Definition).

Part of the migration required you (application teams using this existing Single Sign-On service) to update the KeyCloak configurations. As for now, there is no immediate actions. We will inform the community in #sso channel when ready so that you could plan ahead for some sprint time to work on the relevant tasks.

Here are the migration plan tasks for SSO admin team:
- provision new DNS and obtain IDIM approval
- test out the impact on KeyCloak in a multi-domain setup
- migrate to the new DNS

More details to come as we progress.
