### Test on RC OAuth SSO update:
This is to track community notifications:

We are going to update RC's OAuth integration with BCGov SSO, from `sso.pathfinder.goc.bc.ca` to `oidc.gov.bc.ca`. And we are looking for some volunteers to help us test out this change in a lower environment (test RC instance).

*If you have access to the following usage of RC and 5 minutes, please login to https://chat-test.pathfinder.gov.bc.ca/ with either IDIR or GitHub account now!*
- web browser
- Android RC app
- iOS RC app
- desktop RC app

*Testing steps:*
- drop a message in #general in the test RC instance to let us know you made it!
- if you are on GitHub account and need someone to invite you, please comment here with your *GitHub account* (we'll invite you :))
- at noon we will commence with the OAuth change and ask you to *test again logging into the test RC instance* when its complete
- If you *encounter any issue* while helping us with the test, also let us know here!

Here are the final steps:
- come back *after 11:30am*
- test if your current login session is still valid. You can try sending a new message to verify
- if you have logged out, please try a login again and let us know you made it with the update!
