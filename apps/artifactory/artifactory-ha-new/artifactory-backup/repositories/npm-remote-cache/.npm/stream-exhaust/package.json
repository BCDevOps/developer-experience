It is a separate package because it has\ndifferent semantics:\n\n1. It does not call `.resume()` on streams2+ streams. streams2 streams monkeypatch `.pipe`\nwhen entering flowing mode; avoiding `resume()` avoids that fate.\n2. It does not examine `._readableState`; instead it checks for the presence of `._read`.\n\n## API\n\n### exhaust(Stream s) -> Stream s\n\nTakes a stream, `s`, and returns it. Ensures that the stream is flowing, either by calling\n`.resume()` if the stream is a streams1 stream, or by piping it to a \"black hole\" stream that\ncontinually asks for more data.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n","maintainers":[{"name":"chrisdickinson","email":"chris@neversaw.us"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-08-30T06:13:54.801Z","created":"2014-08-22T07:01:51.090Z","1.0.0":"2014-08-22T07:01:51.090Z","1.0.1":"2015-01-19T00:43:31.174Z","1.0.2":"2017-08-30T06:13:54.801Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/chrisdickinson/stream-exhaust.git","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/chrisdickinson/stream-exhaust.git"},"author":{"name":"Chris Dickinson","email":"chris@neversaw.us"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/chrisdickinson/stream-exhaust.git"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"usingthesystem":true},"_attachments":{}}
