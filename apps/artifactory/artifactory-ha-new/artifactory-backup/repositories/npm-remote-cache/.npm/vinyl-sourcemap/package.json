updatedFile) {\n  // updatedFile will have a .sourceMap property\n});\n\n// The 2nd argument can be given as a path string\nsourcemap.write(file, './maps', function(err, updatedFile, sourcemapFile) {\n  // sourcemapFile will be a Vinyl file to be written to some location\n  // updatedFile will have the .contents property updated with a sourceMappingURL that resolves to sourcemapFile\n});\n\n// If not defined, the sourcemap is inlined\nsourcemap.write(file, function(err, updatedFile, sourcemapFile) {\n  // sourcemapFile is undefined\n  // updatedFile will have the .contents property updated with a sourceMappingURL that is an inlined sourcemap\n});\n```\n\n## API\n\n### `sourcemap.add(file, callback)`\n\nTakes a [Vinyl][vinyl] `file` object and a `callback` function. It attempts to parse an inline sourcemap or load an external sourcemap for the file. If a valid sourcemap is found, the `sources` & `sourcesContent` properties are resolved to actual files (if possible) and a fully resolved sourcemap is attached as `file.sourceMap`. If a sourcemap is not found, a stub sourcemap is generated for the file and attached as `file.sourceMap`.\n\nOnce all resolution is complete, the `callback(err, updatedFile)` is called with the `updatedFile`. If an error occurs, it will be passed as `err` and `updatedFile` will be undefined. __Note:__ The original file is mutated but `updatedFile` is passed to the callback as a convenience.\n\nIf the `file` is not a Vinyl object or the contents are streaming, an Error will be passed to the `callback`.\n\nIf the `file` has a `.sourceMap` property or the contents are null, the `callback` will be called immediately without mutation to the file.\n\nAll filesystem operations are optional & non-fatal so any errors will not be bubbled to the `callback`.\n\n### `sourcemap.write(file, [outputPath,] callback)`\n\nTakes a [Vinyl][vinyl] `file` object, (optionally) an `outputPath` string and a `callback` function.\n\nIf `outputPath` is not passed, an inline sourcemap will be generated from the `file.sourceMap` property and appended to the `file.contents`. Once the inline sourcemap is appended, the `callback(err, updatedFile)` is called with the `updatedFile`. If an error occurs, it will be passed as `err` and `updatedFile` will be undefined. __Note:__ The original file is mutated but `updatedFile` is passed to the callback as a convenience.\n\nIf `outputPath` is passed, a new Vinyl file will be generated using `file.cwd` and `file.base` from the original file, the path to the external sourcemap, and the `file.sourceMap` (as contents). The external location will be appended to the `file.contents` of the original file. Once the new file is created and location appended, the `callback(err, updatedFile, sourcemapFile)` is called with the `updatedFile` and the `sourcemapFile`. If an error occurs, it will be passed as `err` and `updatedFile`/`sourcemapFile` will be undefined. __Note:__ The original file is mutated but `updatedFile` is passed to the callback as a convenience.\n\nIf the `file` is not a Vinyl object or the contents are streaming, an Error will be passed to the `callback`.\n\nIf the `file` doesn't have a `.sourceMap` property or the contents are null, the `callback` will be called immediately without mutation to the file.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n[vinyl]: https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl\n\n[downloads-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/vinyl-sourcemap.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.com/package/vinyl-sourcemap\n[npm-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/v/vinyl-sourcemap.svg\n\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/gulpjs/vinyl-sourcemap\n[travis-image]: http://img.shields.io/travis/gulpjs/vinyl-sourcemap.svg?label=travis-ci\n\n[appveyor-url]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gulpjs/vinyl-sourcemap\n[appveyor-image]: https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/gulpjs/vinyl-sourcemap.svg?label=appveyor\n\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/gulpjs/vinyl-sourcemap\n[coveralls-image]: http://img.shields.io/coveralls/gulpjs/vinyl-sourcemap/master.svg\n\n[gitter-url]: https://gitter.im/gulpjs/gulp\n[gitter-image]: https://badges.gitter.im/gulpjs/gulp.png\n","maintainers":[{"email":"yo@contra.io","name":"contra"},{"email":"blaine.bublitz@gmail.com","name":"phated"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-08-18T22:55:26.701Z","created":"2017-03-14T01:27:35.852Z","0.1.0":"2017-03-14T01:27:35.852Z","0.1.1":"2017-03-16T23:12:02.841Z","0.2.0":"2017-03-20T23:01:15.253Z","0.3.0":"2017-03-23T23:48:57.696Z","0.4.0":"2017-05-03T17:20:47.990Z","1.0.0":"2017-06-18T20:20:06.680Z","1.1.0":"2017-08-01T19:36:06.962Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl-sourcemap#readme","keywords":["vinyl","sourcemap","gulp"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl-sourcemap.git"},"author":{"name":"Gulp Team","email":"team@gulpjs.com","url":"http://gulpjs.com/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl-sourcemap/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","contributors":[{"name":"Robin Venneman"},{"name":"Blaine Bublitz","email":"blaine.bublitz@gmail.com"}],"_attachments":{}}
