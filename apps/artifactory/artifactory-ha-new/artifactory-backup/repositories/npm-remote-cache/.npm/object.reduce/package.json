accumulated result of running each property in the object through a callback.\n\n## Install\n\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save object.reduce\n```\n\nInstall with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):\n\n```sh\n$ yarn add object.reduce\n```\n\nInstall with [bower](https://bower.io/)\n\n```sh\n$ bower install object.reduce --save\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nthe initial value (or value from the previous callback call), the `value` of the current property, the `key` of the current property, and the `object` over which the function is iterating. Node.js/JavaScript utility.)_\n\n**Params**\n\n* `object` **{Object}**: The object to iterate over (the iteratee)\n* `fn` **{Function}**: The function invoked per iteration.\n* `init` **{Object}**: The initial value to use for the accumulator.\n* `thisArg` **{Object}**: (optional) Object to use as the invocation context for the iterator (expose as `this` inside the iterator)\n\nExecutes the given callback `fn` once for each own enumerable property in the object. The callback receives the following arguments:\n\n* `acc`: the initial value (or value from the previous callback call),\n* `value`: the of the current property,\n* `key`: the of the current property, and\n* the original `object` over which the function is iterating.\n\n**Example**\n\n```js\nvar reduce = require('object.reduce');\nvar a = {a: 'foo', b: 'bar', c: 'baz'};\n\nreduce(a, function(acc, value, key, obj) {\n  acc[key] = value.toUpperCase();\n  return acc;\n}, {});\n\n//=> {a: 'FOO', b: 'BAR', c: 'BAZ'};\n```\n\n## About\n\n### Contributing\n\nPull requests and stars are always welcome.
