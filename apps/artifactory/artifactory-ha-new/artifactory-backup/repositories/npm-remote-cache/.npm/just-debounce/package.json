a basic debounce function\n\n# Why?\nI searched npm and the first 3 pages of results for \"debounce\" did not have a\nsmall correctly implemented version of debounce\n\n# Usage\n\n### arguments\n* `fn`: the function to debounce\n* `delay`: debounce delay in ms\n* `at_start:` if true, the function will be called at the beginning of the\ndelay rather than the end\n* `guarantee`: ensures the time before the next call the `fn` is not greater \\\nthan the delay period.\n\n```javascript\nvar db = require('just-debounce')\n\nvar debounced = db(function(v) {console.log(v)}, 100)\n\ndebounced('hi')\ndebounced('hi')\n// logs 'hi' once after 100ms\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar db = require('just-debounce')\n\nvar debounced = db(function(v) {console.log(v)}, 100, true)\n\ndebounced('hi')\ndebounced('hi')\n// logs 'hi' once right away, but not a second time. calling after 100ms will log again\n```\n\n```javascript\nvar db = require('just-debounce')\n\nvar debounced = db(function(v) {console.log(v)}, 100, false, true)\n\ndebounced('hi')\nsetTimeout(function() {debounced('hi2')}, 80)\n\n// logs 'hi2' once 100ms after the first call to debounced\n```\n\n#
