The `callback(error, dirpath, mode)` must be called with the `dirpath` to be created as the 2nd parameter or an `error` as the 1st parameter; optionally with a `mode` as the 3rd parameter.\n\nIf the `resolver` is a string, it will be created/ensured for each chunk (e.g. if it were deleted between chunks, it would be recreated). When using a string, a custom `mode` can't be used.\n\n### `mkdirpStream.obj(resolver)`\n\nThe same as the top-level API but for object streams. See the example to see the benefit of object streams with this module.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\nContains a custom implementation of `mkdirp` originally based on https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp (Licensed MIT/X11 - Copyright 2010 James Halliday) with heavy modification to better support custom modes.\n\n[downloads-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/fs-mkdirp-stream.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.com/package/fs-mkdirp-stream\n[npm-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/v/fs-mkdirp-stream.svg\n\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/gulpjs/fs-mkdirp-stream\n[travis-image]: http://img.shields.io/travis/gulpjs/fs-mkdirp-stream.svg?label=travis-ci\n\n[appveyor-url]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gulpjs/fs-mkdirp-stream\n[appveyor-image]: https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/gulpjs/fs-mkdirp-stream.svg?label=appveyor\n\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/gulpjs/fs-mkdirp-stream\n[coveralls-image]: http://img.shields.io/coveralls/gulpjs/fs-mkdirp-stream/master.svg\n\n[gitter-url]: https://gitter.im/gulpjs/gulp\n[gitter-image]: https://badges.gitter.im/gulpjs/gulp.png\n","maintainers":[{"email":"yo@contra.io","name":"contra"},{"email":"blaine.bublitz@gmail.com","name":"phated"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-08-18T22:55:35.801Z","created":"2017-05-14T00:04:31.877Z","1.0.0":"2017-05-14T00:04:31.877Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/gulpjs/fs-mkdirp-stream#readme","keywords":["fs","mkdirp","stream","mkdir","directory","directories","ensure"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/gulpjs/fs-mkdirp-stream.git"},"contributors":[{"name":"Blaine Bublitz","email":"blaine.bublitz@gmail.com"}],"author":{"name":"Gulp Team","email":"team@gulpjs.com","url":"http://gulpjs.com/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/gulpjs/fs-mkdirp-stream/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
