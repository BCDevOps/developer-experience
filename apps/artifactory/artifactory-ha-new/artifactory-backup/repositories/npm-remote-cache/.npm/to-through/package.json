[![Coveralls Status][coveralls-image]][coveralls-url] [![Gitter chat][gitter-image]][gitter-url]\n\nWrap a ReadableStream in a TransformStream.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar from = require('from2');\nvar concat = require('concat-stream');\nvar toThrough = require('to-through');\n\nvar readable = from([' ', 'hello', ' ', 'world']);\n\n// Can be used as a Readable or Transform\nvar maybeTransform = toThrough(readable);\n\nfrom(['hi', ' ', 'there', ','])\n  .pipe(maybeTransform)\n  .pipe(concat(function(result) {\n    // result.toString() === 'hi there, hello world'\n  }));\n```\n\n## API\n\n### `toThrough(readableStream)`\n\nTakes a `readableStream` as the only argument and returns a `through2` stream. If the returned stream is piped before `nextTick`, the wrapped `readableStream` will not flow until the upstream is flushed. If the stream is not piped before `nextTick`, it is ended and flushed (acting as a proper readable).\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n[downloads-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/to-through.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.com/package/to-through\n[npm-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/v/to-through.svg\n\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/gulpjs/to-through\n[travis-image]: http://img.shields.io/travis/gulpjs/to-through.svg?label=travis-ci\n\n[appveyor-url]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gulpjs/to-through\n[appveyor-image]: https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/gulpjs/to-through.svg?label=appveyor\n\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/gulpjs/to-through\n[coveralls-image]: http://img.shields.io/coveralls/gulpjs/to-through/master.svg\n\n[gitter-url]: https://gitter.im/gulpjs/gulp\n[gitter-image]: https://badges.gitter.im/gulpjs/gulp.png\n","maintainers":[{"email":"yo@contra.io","name":"contra"},{"email":"blaine.bublitz@gmail.com","name":"phated"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-08-18T22:57:45.103Z","created":"2017-05-03T00:32:07.541Z","1.0.0":"2017-05-03T00:32:07.541Z","1.0.1":"2017-05-03T00:48:14.342Z","2.0.0":"2017-05-03T18:13:52.644Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/gulpjs/to-through#readme","keywords":["transform","readable","through","wrap"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/gulpjs/to-through.git"},"contributors":[{"name":"Blaine Bublitz","email":"blaine.bublitz@gmail.com"}],"author":{"name":"Gulp Team","email":"team@gulpjs.com","url":"http://gulpjs.com/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/gulpjs/to-through/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{}}
