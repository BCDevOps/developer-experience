`extensions` object and a `callback` function that is called upon completion of the iterations.\n\nAll iterations run in parallel.\n\n#### `values`\n\nAn array or object of values to iterate over.\n\nIf `values` is an array, iterations are started in order by index. If `values` is an object, iterations are started in order by the order returned by `Object.keys` (order is not guaranteed).\n\nIf `values` is an array, the results of each iteration will be mapped to an array. If `values` is an object, the results of each iteration will be mapped to an object with corresponding keys.\n\n#### `iterator(value, key, done)`\n\nAn async function called per iteration. All iterations are run in parallel.\n\nThe `iterator` function is called once with each `value`, `key` and a function (`done(error, result)`) to call when the async work is complete.\n\nIf `done` is passed an error as the first argument, the iteration will fail and the sequence will be ended; however, any iterations in progress will still complete. If `done` is passed a `result` value as the second argument, it will be added to the final results array or object.\n\n#### `extensions`\n\nThe `extensions` object is used for specifying functions that give insight into the lifecycle of each iteration. The possible extension points are `create`, `before`, `after` and `error`. If an extension point is not specified, it defaults to a no-op function.\n\n##### `extensions.create(value, key)`\n\nCalled at the very beginning of each iteration with the `value` being iterated and the `key` from the array or object. If `create` returns a value (`storage`), it is passed to the `before`, `after` and `error` extension points.\n\nIf a value is not returned, an empty object is used as `storage` for each other extension point.\n\nThis is useful for tracking information across an iteration.\n\n##### `extensions.before(storage)`\n\nCalled immediately before each iteration with the `storage` value returned from the `create` extension point.\n\n##### `extensions.after(result, storage)`\n\nCalled immediately after each iteration with the `result` of the iteration and the `storage` value returned from the `create` extension point.\n\n##### `extensions.error(error, storage)`\n\nCalled immediately after a failed iteration with the `error` of the iteration and the `storage` value returned from the `create` extension point.\n\n#### `callback(error, results)`\n\nA function that is called after all iterations have completed or one iteration has errored.\n\nIf all iterations completed successfully, the `error` argument will be empty and the `results` will be a mapping of the `iterator` results.\n\nIf an iteration errored, the `error` argument will be passed from that iteration and the `results` will be whatever partial results had completed successfully before the error occurred.\n\n### `mapSeries(values, iterator[, extensions][, callback])`\n\nTakes an object or array of `values` and an `iterator` function to execute with each value.\nOptionally, takes an `extensions` object and a `callback` function that is called upon completion of the iterations.\n\nAll iterations run in serial.\n\n#### `values`\n\nAn array or object of values to iterate over.\n\nIf `values` is an array, iterations are started in order by index. If `values` is an object, iterations are started in order by the order returned by `Object.keys` (order is not guaranteed).\n\nIf `values` is an array, the results of each iteration will be mapped to an array. If `values` is an object, the results of each iteration will be mapped to an object with corresponding keys.\n\n#### `iterator(value, key, done)`\n\nAn async function called per iteration. All iterations are run in serial.\n\nThe `iterator` function is called once with each `value`, `key` and a function (`done(error, result)`) to call when the async work is complete.\n\nIf `done` is passed an error as the first argument, the iteration will fail and the sequence will be ended without executing any more iterations. If `done` is passed a `result` value as the second argument, it will be added to the final results array or object.\n\n#### `extensions`\n\nThe `extensions` object is used for specifying functions that give insight into the lifecycle of each iteration. The possible extension points are `create`, `before`, `after` and `error`. If an extension point is not specified, it defaults to a no-op function.\n\n##### `extensions.create(value, key)`\n\nCalled at the very beginning of each iteration with the `value` being iterated and the `key` from the array or object. If `create` returns a value (`storage`), it is passed to the `before`, `after` and `error` extension points.\n\nIf a value is not returned, an empty object is used as `storage` for each other extension point.\n\nThis is useful for tracking information across an iteration.\n\n##### `extensions.before(storage)`\n\nCalled immediately before each iteration with the `storage` value returned from the `create` extension point.\n\n##### `extensions.after(result, storage)`\n\nCalled immediately after each iteration with the `result` of the iteration and the `storage` value returned from the `create` extension point.\n\n##### `extensions.error(error, storage)`\n\nCalled immediately after a failed iteration with the `error` of the iteration and the `storage` value returned from the `create` extension point.\n\n#### `callback(error, results)`\n\nA function that is called after all iterations have completed or one iteration has errored.\n\nIf all iterations completed successfully, the `error` argument will be empty and the `results` will be a mapping of the `iterator` results.\n\nIf an iteration errored, the `error` argument will be passed from that iteration and the `results` will be whatever partial results had completed successfully before the error occurred.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n\n[downloads-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/now-and-later.svg\n[npm-url]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/now-and-later\n[npm-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/v/now-and-later.svg\n\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/gulpjs/now-and-later\n[travis-image]: http://img.shields.io/travis/gulpjs/now-and-later.svg?label=travis-ci\n\n[appveyor-url]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/gulpjs/now-and-later\n[appveyor-image]: https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/gulpjs/now-and-later.svg?label=appveyor\n\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/gulpjs/now-and-later\n[coveralls-image]: http://img.shields.io/coveralls/gulpjs/now-and-later/master.svg\n\n[gitter-url]: https://gitter.im/gulpjs/gulp\n[gitter-image]: https://badges.gitter.im/gulpjs/gulp.svg\n","maintainers":[{"email":"yo@contra.io","name":"contra"},{"email":"blaine.bublitz@gmail.com","name":"phated"}],"time":{"modified":"2019-04-06T03:19:07.805Z","created":"2014-08-17T00:56:08.041Z","0.0.0":"2014-08-17T00:56:08.041Z","0.0.1":"2014-08-17T02:15:04.142Z","0.0.2":"2014-08-17T21:55:04.781Z","0.0.3":"2014-08-18T04:38:01.999Z","0.0.4":"2014-08-23T22:12:21.557Z","0.0.5":"2014-08-31T17:48:07.542Z","0.0.6":"2014-09-01T22:08:35.851Z","1.0.0":"2016-06-27T19:00:55.525Z","2.0.0":"2017-06-17T15:55:39.509Z","2.0.1":"2019-04-06T03:19:05.296Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/gulpjs/now-and-later#readme","keywords":["async","async.js","map","control","flow","extension","tracing","debug","aop","aspect","timing","tracing"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/gulpjs/now-and-later.git"},"author":{"name":"Gulp Team","email":"team@gulpjs.com","url":"http://gulpjs.com/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/gulpjs/now-and-later/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","contributors":[{"name":"Blaine Bublitz","email":"blaine.bublitz@gmail.com"}]}
