See reference [here](https://docs.documize.com/s/WNEpptWJ9AABRnha/administration-guides/d/WNEp8tWJ9AABRnhj/authenticating-with-redhat-keycloak)
For BCGov Documize settings, there are
- a local user in the master realm for the application realm user query (view users permission)
- a dedicated client in the `devhub` realm
- IDIR and GitHub identity providers


### Space Settings:
- space visibility
  - public: all users could see the content from the space
  - protected: only users with permission could see/edit
- space label
  - only one label could be assigned to a space
  - creating new labels is admin only action (the current labels correspond to different ministries)
- clone
  - template from existing spaces
  - permission from existing spaces (helpful for admin management, the new space owner will need to be updated)


### User Groups/Roles:
- admin group: gives access to all spaces
- new users are only assigned with `active`, space manage/owner needs to login which pre-creates the account
- when a new space is requested, admin user creates it and assign the space manage/owner to an existing account
- space manage/owner is responsible to manage any further access for the space
